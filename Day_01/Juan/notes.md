It talks about ASCII code, bits, binary and Unicode using emojis, it's pretty cool that like every years they make a new recording of the course, so the guy here is wearing a mask again

Anyway, he explains that computers aren't more than switches that we can turn on and off, and then he made a translation from that switches to binary code, and explained how ASCII code starts with the letter A and every unicode char it is represented in the chart with a number that the computer translate to bits.

### Colors

Colors in computers are RGB, Red, Green and Blue, so images are composed by dots and every image use 24 bits for every dot, like 8 for red, 8 for green and 8 for blue.

How to represent videos using only 0s and 1s?
