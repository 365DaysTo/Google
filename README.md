# 365DaysToGoogle
365 Days of study and preparation to get an internship and then a job at Google.

## Study Program

### Introduction

Let's make a quick introduction to Computer Science, since we're trying to become Software Engineers, we should try and understand or rehash the fundamentals of our craft and using the old "Google dev guide" we will do the following courses:

1. Harvard - CS50: https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/
2. Udemy - CS101 - Intro to computer programming: https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110

### Programming

We should start reading "Composing programs", then "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" which is free on the internet, later on we should read "How to design programs"

Also we should grasp the fundamental (but try and master for the end of the year) of:

1. JavaScript
2. C++
3. Java
4. CSS & HTML
5. Ruby
6. PHP
7. C
8. Perl
9. Shell script
10. Lisp
11. Scheme

Also we should complete 

"Free Code Camp": https://freecodecamp.org (we will try and get all the certifications for our linkedin and portfolio) and Code Academy.

We can use our udemy accounts and make all the course we can in there to add certificates and expand our profiles as developers.

For a more in deep learning about programming with a more hands-on approach we should do the following courses:

At the end of the day, we can make a Code Kata in codewars

### Algorithms and Data Structures

Let's read some more n.n

1. The Algorithm Design Manual
2. How to solve it

Also we can add the following courses:

1. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2008/index.htm
2. https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1
3. https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2
4. https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/
5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms
6. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures
7. http://timroughgarden.org/videos.html

### Computer Architecture

Let's read again

1. Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
2. The Elements of Computing Systems (nand2tetris)
3. Computer Organization and Design

### Testing our Code

We need to learn how to catch bugs, create tests and break our own software

1. https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258
2. https://www.udacity.com/course/software-debugging--cs259

### Mathematics for Computer Science

Let's read some cute books:

1. Professor Lov√°sz lectures: https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf
2. Mathematics for Computer Science: https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf

And now, let's watch some courses:

1. https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking
2. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm
3. https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics
4. https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models
5. https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1

### Operative Systems

Booky books:

1. Operating Systems Concepts (The dinosaur book)
2. Moderm Operating Systems (The Tanembaum big one)

After those books we can read and watch the following: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/

Also, we can watch the following tutorial and build a bugged OS as a presentation card:
